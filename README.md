# Free Science Definition

An adaptation of the [Free Software Definition](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) within the context of science and science dissemination, redefining the four essential freedoms.


## The four essential freedoms

### Science is free if scientists[1] have the four essential freedoms:

- The freedom to use research results as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
 
- The freedom to study how research was conducted, and change it as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code and data is a precondition for this.

- The freedom to redistribute copies of research results so you can help others (freedom 2).

- The freedom to distribute copies of your modified research results to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code and data is a precondition for this.


[1] This can be very broadly defined, including anyone who applies the scientific method or wants to contribute to any part of science (e.g. citizen science).
